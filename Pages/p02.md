# 🌟 **Tutorial: Hypothesis Testing**

### 📌 **1. What is Hypothesis Testing?**

✅ **Definition:**
A statistical method to decide if there is enough evidence in a sample to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population.

🔧 *Example:* Testing if a new drug is more effective than the existing one.

---

### 📌 **2. Null and Alternative Hypotheses**

#### 🔹 **2.1 Null Hypothesis (H₀)**

✅ **Definition:**
The default statement that there is **no effect** or **no difference**.

✔️ *Example:* The mean weight loss using the new drug is equal to the old drug.

---

#### 🔹 **2.2 Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)**

✅ **Definition:**
The statement you want to test – that **there is an effect** or **a difference**.

✔️ *Example:* The mean weight loss using the new drug is **greater than** the old drug.

### 📌 **3. Type I and Type II Errors**

| **Error Type**        | **Meaning**                           | **Real-World Example**                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type I Error (α)**  | Rejecting H₀ when it is true          | Concluding the new drug works better when it actually doesn't     |
| **Type II Error (β)** | Failing to reject H₀ when it is false | Concluding the new drug doesn't work better when it actually does |

🎯 **Memory Tip:**

* **Type I:** False Positive
* **Type II:** False Negative

### 📌 **4. Significance Level (α)**

✅ **Definition:**
The probability of making a Type I error. Common values are **0.05 (5%)** or **0.01 (1%)**.

✔️ **Interpretation:**
If α = 0.05, you are willing to accept a **5% chance of wrongly rejecting H₀**.

---

### 📌 **5. p-value Concept**

✅ **Definition:**
The probability of observing the sample result, or something more extreme, if **H₀ is true**.

✔️ **Decision Rule:**

* If **p-value < α** → Reject H₀
* If **p-value ≥ α** → Fail to reject H₀

🔧 *Example:*
If p-value = 0.03 and α = 0.05, we **reject H₀**, suggesting significant difference.

---

### 📌 **6. One-tailed and Two-tailed Tests**

#### 🔹 **6.1 One-tailed Test**

✅ **Used when:** Testing if the parameter is **greater than or less than** a value.

✔️ *Example:* Testing if new drug is **better** (not just different).

---

#### 🔹 **6.2 Two-tailed Test**

✅ **Used when:** Testing if the parameter is **different (either way)**.

✔️ *Example:* Testing if new drug is **different** (could be better or worse).

🔧 *Visual Summary:*

| **Test Type**      | **Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)** |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| One-tailed (Right) | μ > μ₀                          |
| One-tailed (Left)  | μ < μ₀                          |
| Two-tailed         | μ ≠ μ₀                          |

---

### 📌 **7. Power of a Test**

✅ **Definition:**
The probability of **correctly rejecting H₀** when it is false. (i.e., detecting an effect when there is one)

✔️ **Formula:**
Power = 1 - β

✔️ **Why Important?**

* High power reduces Type II errors.
* Ensures your test is sensitive enough to detect real differences.

🔧 *Factors affecting power:*

* Sample size (larger sample → higher power)
* Effect size (larger effect → higher power)
* Significance level α (higher α → higher power, but also more Type I errors)
* Variability (less variability → higher power)

---

### 📌 **Example in Python**

Let’s perform a **one-sample t-test** to illustrate hypothesis testing:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Sample data
sample = [51, 53, 49, 50, 52, 54, 48, 50, 51, 53]
popmean = 50  # Hypothesized population mean

# Perform t-test
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(sample, popmean)

print("t-statistic:", t_stat)
print("p-value:", p_value)

# Decision
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject Null Hypothesis (significant difference)")
else:
    print("Fail to Reject Null Hypothesis (no significant difference)")
```

✅ **Interpretation:**

* Calculate t-statistic and p-value.
* Compare p-value with α to decide.
