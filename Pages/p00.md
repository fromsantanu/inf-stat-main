## üîç **Inferential Statistics:**

### üîπ **Definition:**

Inferential statistics refers to the set of methods used to **draw conclusions or make inferences about a population** based on data collected from a sample.

### üîπ **Key Concepts:**

* **Population**: The entire group you want to study.
* **Sample**: A subset of the population used to represent the whole.
* **Parameter**: A measurable characteristic of the population (e.g., population mean).
* **Statistic**: A measurable characteristic of the sample (e.g., sample mean).

### üîπ **Main Tools:**

* **Confidence Intervals** ‚Äì Estimate the range in which a population parameter lies.
* **Hypothesis Testing** ‚Äì Evaluate assumptions about a population parameter.
* **Regression Analysis** ‚Äì Predict one variable based on another.
* **ANOVA, t-tests, z-tests, chi-square tests**, etc.

### ‚úÖ **How It Helps in Data Analysis:**

* Makes it possible to **generalize results** from a sample to a larger population.
* Helps assess **relationships** and **differences** between variables.
* Assists in **decision making** under uncertainty.

## üß™ **Hypothesis Testing:**

### üîπ **Definition:**

Hypothesis testing is a **formal procedure** to evaluate two competing claims (hypotheses) about a population using sample data.

### üîπ **Steps in Hypothesis Testing:**

1. **State Hypotheses**:

   * **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: Assumes no effect or difference.
   * **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ or Ha)**: Assumes some effect or difference.

2. **Choose Significance Level (Œ±)**:

   * Common values: 0.05, 0.01
   * Represents the probability of rejecting H‚ÇÄ when it is actually true.

3. **Select the Test and Calculate the Test Statistic**:

   * Based on the type of data and analysis (e.g., t-test, z-test, chi-square test).

4. **Find p-value**:

   * The probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as those observed under H‚ÇÄ.

5. **Make a Decision**:

   * If **p ‚â§ Œ±**, reject the null hypothesis.
   * If **p > Œ±**, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

### üõ†Ô∏è **How It Helps in Data Analysis:**

* Validates whether observed differences or relationships in data are **statistically significant**.
* Reduces the chance of making incorrect conclusions due to **random variation**.
* Supports **evidence-based decisions** in business, healthcare, science, etc.

## ‚úÖ **Real-World Example:**

Suppose a pharmaceutical company wants to test if a new drug is more effective than the current one.

* **Inferential statistics** will allow them to use data from a **sample of patients** to draw conclusions about the **entire population** of patients.
* They‚Äôll set up a **hypothesis test**:

  * H‚ÇÄ: New drug = Old drug
  * H‚ÇÅ: New drug ‚â† Old drug
* If the **p-value < 0.05**, they may conclude the new drug **has a statistically significant effect**.
