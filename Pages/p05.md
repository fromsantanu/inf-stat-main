# 🌟 **Tutorial: Correlation and Association**

### 📌 **1. What is Correlation?**

✅ **Definition:**
A statistical measure showing **how strongly two variables are related** and the **direction** of the relationship.

✔️ **Types:**

* **Positive correlation:** Both increase/decrease together.
* **Negative correlation:** One increases, the other decreases.
* **No correlation:** No relationship.

---

## ✨ **2. Pearson Correlation**

✅ **Use when:**
Both variables are **continuous and normally distributed**, with a **linear relationship**.

🔧 **Range:** -1 to +1

* +1 → perfect positive linear
* -1 → perfect negative linear
* 0 → no linear relationship

✔️ **Example:** Relationship between height and weight.

🔧 **Python Example:**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

x = [160, 165, 170, 175, 180]
y = [55, 60, 65, 70, 75]

r, p_value = stats.pearsonr(x, y)
print("Pearson correlation coefficient:", r)
print("p-value:", p_value)
```

✅ **Interpretation:**

* **r > 0:** Positive relationship
* **r < 0:** Negative relationship
* **p-value < 0.05:** Significant relationship

## ✨ **3. Spearman Rank Correlation**

✅ **Use when:**

* Data is **ordinal** or **not normally distributed**
* **Monotonic** but not necessarily linear relationship

🔧 **Range:** -1 to +1 (similar interpretation to Pearson)

✔️ **Example:** Relationship between math and physics ranks in class.

🔧 **Python Example:**

```python
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [3, 2, 4, 1, 5]

rho, p_value = stats.spearmanr(x, y)
print("Spearman rank correlation:", rho)
print("p-value:", p_value)
```

✅ **Interpretation:**

* **rho > 0:** As one rank increases, so does the other.
* **rho < 0:** As one rank increases, the other decreases.
* **p-value < 0.05:** Significant monotonic relationship.

## ✨ **4. Chi-Square Test for Association**

✅ **Use when:**
Testing **association between two categorical variables** (also known as **test of independence**).

✔️ **Example:**
Is there an association between **gender (male/female)** and **product preference (A/B)**?

🔧 **Python Example:**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Contingency table
# Rows: Gender (Male, Female)
# Columns: Product Preference (A, B)
data = np.array([[30, 10], [20, 40]])

chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(data)

print("Chi-square statistic:", chi2)
print("p-value:", p)
```

✅ **Interpretation:**

* **p-value < 0.05:** Significant association between the two categorical variables.
* **p-value ≥ 0.05:** No significant association.

## ✅ **Summary Table**

| **Test**                            | **Use Case**                                           | **Data Type**                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Pearson Correlation**             | Measure linear relationship strength and direction     | Continuous, normal               |
| **Spearman Rank Correlation**       | Measure monotonic relationship (non-linear acceptable) | Ordinal or non-normal continuous |
| **Chi-Square Test for Association** | Test association between two categorical variables     | Categorical                      |
